                The old bus terminus on Old Jail Road in Mint has been restored with basic facilities, which include steel shelters, bus bays, concrete flooring, lighting and a seating arrangement for commuters.
                Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) carried out the restoration of the terminus during the lockdown months, honouring the terms of an agreement with Greater Chennai Corporation. 
                CMRL had acquired land from the terminus for the construction of a Metro Rail station.
